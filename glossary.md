## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git (Github Docs, 2024), allowing users to manage and share code in various repositories and offering wikis for documentation and collaborative editing (Kinsta, 2024).


## Wiki


Wikis are web-based, collaborative software that enable people to modify content by directly editing pages online (Ebersach, Glasser, and Heigl, 2005). In educational contexts, they facilitate student engagement in a collaborative learning environment (Parker and Chao, 2007).

The term "Wiki Wiki Web" was inspired by the "Wiki Wiki Shuttle" at Honolulu International Airport, as named by Ward Cunningham (Anderson and Serra, 2010). In Hawaiian, "Wiki" means "quick" or "fast."

There are numerous platforms for running wikis. Among the most popular are  [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/), [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), and [GitHub](Glossary#github).
